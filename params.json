It is developed using HTML+PHP+JS+CSS\r\n\r\n### Goal:\r\nThe goal is to implement most of the XBMC JSON-RPC controls to a web interface that can be used on any platform. So far I have implemented some of the TV Show Details and hope to expand on it. This can also be used as a showcase of all the media on XBMC.\r\n\r\n### Installation:\r\n1. Download the repo using the \"ZIP\" button on github or clone it.\r\n2. Extract the archive to the webserver root.\r\n3. Modify the _settings.php_ and provide the username, password, ip and port of the XBMC web interface (find it in XBMC: \"System>Services>Webserver\" and make sure the \"Allow control of XBMC via HTTP\" is enabled).\r\n4. Start web server\r\n5. Navigate to the page\r\n","google":"UA-41548621-1","note":"Don't delete this file! It's used internally to help with page regeneration."}
